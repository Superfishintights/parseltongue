Legal variable names are ones that don't begin with a number, and can only contain numbers, letters and underscores

randomvariablename123
nameforavariable321
called_this

the above are all legal as they conform to the rules above.

_1123name
123name
123413

the above are illegal as they begin with numbers or underscores and won't be recognised by python when attepting to run a script.
