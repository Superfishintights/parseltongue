# Car Salesman Program
# Write a Car Salesman program where the user enters the base price of a car. The program should add on a bunch of extra fees such as tax, license, dealer prep, and destination charge. Make tax and license a percent of the base price. The other fees should be set values. Display the actual price of the car once all the extras are applied.
